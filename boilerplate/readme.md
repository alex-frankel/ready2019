# Managing Blueprints as Code

#### !! Disclaimer !!
This doc is based on a powershell script that is managed by the community and is not officially supported by Microsoft. The Blueprints team is fast at work finishing official powershell cmdlets and azure cli commands. This doc will be updated once that happens.

## Prerequisites

This doc assumes you have a basic understanding of how blueprints work. If you've never used Blueprints before, this will be a little overwhelming. We recommend you build your first blueprint with the UI to understand how everything works. You can try it at [aka.ms/getblueprints](https://aka.ms/getblueprints) and learn more about it in the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) or watch this [10 minute overview](https://youtu.be/grt6uB9XxvU?t=1543).

Download the [Manage-AzureRMBlueprint script](https://powershellgallery.com/packages/Manage-AzureRMBlueprint) from the powershell gallery. At the time of this writing the latest is version 2.0. In addition to helping you manage your Blueprints as Code, this script is also helpful for moving a Blueprint between Management Groups or between Azure Tenants.
Using the Blueprints in the Azure Portal is a great way to get started with Blueprints or to use Blueprints on a small-ish scale, but often youâ€™ll want to manage your Blueprints as code for a variety of reasons, such as:
* Sharing blueprints
* Keeping blueprints in source control
* Putting blueprints in a CI/CD or release pipeline

## How to use this guide
This guide references the files in the Boilerplate directory and deploys the Boilerplate blueprint as a draft definition to Azure.

## Structure of blueprint artifacts
A blueprint consists of the main blueprint json file and a series of artifact json files. Simple ðŸ˜Š

So you will always have something like the following:

```
Blueprint directory (also the default blueprint name)
* blueprint.json
* artifact.json
* ...
* more-artifacts.json
```
<!-- <img src="image of blueprint directory" /> -->

### Blueprint folder
Create a folder or directory on your computer to store all of your blueprint files. **The name of this folder will be the default name of the blueprint** unless you specify a new name in the blueprint json file.

### Functions
At the time we support the following functions. They work exactly like they do in a regular ARM template.
* [parameters()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions-deployment#parameters)
* [concat()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions-array#concat)

### Blueprint
This is your main Blueprint file. In order to be processed successfully, the blueprint must be created in Azure before any artifacts (policy, role, template) otherwise the calls to push those artifacts will fail. That's because the **artifacts are child resources of a blueprint**. The `Manage-AzureRmBlueprint` script takes care of this for you automatically. Typically, you will name this 01-blueprint.json so that it is sorted alphabetically first, but this name is up to you and doesn't affect anything.


Let's look at our Boilerplate sample ```blueprint.json``` file:
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "description": "This will be displayed in the essentials, so make it good",
        "targetScope": "subscription",
        "parameters": { 
            "principalIds": {
                "type": "string",
                "metadata": {
                    "displayName": "Display Name for Blueprint parameter",
                    "descripiton": "This is a blueprint parameter that any artifact can reference. We'll display these descriptions for you in the info bubble",
                    "strongType": "PrincipalId"
                }
            },
            "genericBlueprintParameter": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "resourceGroups": {
            "SingleRG": {
                "description": "An optional description for your RG artifact. FYI location and name properties can be left out and we will assume they are assignment-time parameters",
                "location": "eastus"
            }
        }
    },
    "type": "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints" 
}
```
Some key takeaways to note from this example:
* There are two optional blueprint `parameters`:
    - ```principalIds``` and ```genericBlueprintParameter```. 
    - These parameters can be referenced in any artifact.
* The ```resourceGroups``` artifacts are declared here, not in their own files.


### Resource Group properties
You'll notice the **resource group artifacts are defined within the main blueprint json file**. In this case, we've configured a resource group with these properties: 
 * Hardcodes a location for the resource group of ```eastus```
 * Sets a placeholder name ```SingleRG``` for the resource group. 
     - This means the resource group name will be determined at assignment time. The placeholder is just to help you organize the definition and serves as a reference point for your artifacts.
     - Optionally you could hardcode the resource group name by adding ```"name": "myRgName"```.

[Full spec of a blueprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/blueprints/blueprints/createorupdate#blueprint)

### Artifacts

Letâ€™s look at the Boilerplate ```policyAssignment.json``` artifact:
```json
{
    "properties": {
        "policyDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/a451c1ef-c6ca-483d-87d-f49761e3ffb5",
        "parameters": {},
        "dependsOn": [],
        "displayName": "My Policy Definition that will be assigned (Currently auditing usage of custome roles)"
    },
    "kind": "policyAssignment",
    "type": "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/artifacts"
}
```

All artifacts share common properties:
* The ```Kind``` can be:
    - ```template```
    - ```roleAssignment```
    - ```policyAssignment```
* ```Type``` â€“ this will always be: ```Microsoft.Bluprint/blueprints/artifacts```
* ```properties``` â€“ this is what defines the artifact itself. Some properties of ```properties``` are common while others are specific to each type.
    - Common properties
        - ```dependsOn``` - optional. You can declare dependencies to other artifacts by referencing the artifact name (which by default is the filename w/o `.json`). More info [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/concepts/sequencing-order#customizing-the-sequencing-order).
        - ```resourceGroup``` â€“ optional. Use the resource group placeholder name to target this artifact to that resource group. If this property isn't specified it will target the subscription.

Full spec for each artifact type:

* [Policy Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/blueprints/artifacts/createorupdate#policyassignmentartifact)
* [Role Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/blueprints/artifacts/createorupdate#roleassignmentartifact)
* [Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/blueprints/artifacts/createorupdate#templateartifact)

### How Parameters work
Nearly everything can be parameterized. The only things that can't be parameterized are the ```roleDefinitionId``` and ```policyDefinitionId``` in the ```rbacAssignment``` and ```policyAssignment``` artifacts respectively. Some explanation for why this is, something about linked access checks.
Parameters are set on the main blueprint file and can be referenced in any artifact. 

Here's a simple parameter declaration which is a simplified version from ```blueprint.json```:
```json
"parameters": { 
    "genericBlueprintParameter": {
        "type": "string"
    }
}
```
You can use the same properties you can in an ARM template like `defaultValue`, `allowedValues`, etc.

And we reference a parameter in `rbacAssignment.json`:
```json
"properties": {
    "principalIds": ["[parameters('principalIds')]"],
}
```

This gets a little complicated when you want to pass those variables to an artifact that, itself, can also have parameters. 

First, in `template.json` we need to map the *blueprint* parameter to the *artifact* parameter like this:
```json
"properties": {
    "parameters": {
        "myTemplateParameter": {
            "value": "[parameters('genericBlueprintParameter')]"
        }
    }
}
```

And then you can reference that parameter within the `template` section in `template.json` like this:
```json
"template": {
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "myTemplateParameter": {
            "type":"string"
        }
    },
},
```

The [AxAzureBlueprint](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AxAzureBlueprint/1.0.0) powershell module has a cmdlet called ```Import-AzureBlueprintArtifact``` that can automatically convert an ARM template into a blueprint template artifact and map all the parameter references for you. It's a good way to understand how everything works.

### Push the Blueprint definition to Azure
Now weâ€™ll take advantage of the [Manage-AzureRMBlueprint]() script and push it to Azure. We can do so by running the following command. You should be in the directory of where your blueprint artifacts are saved.
```powershell
Manage-AzureRMBlueprint -mode Import -ImportDir ".\" -ManagementGroupID "ManagementGroupId"
```

You will be asked to choose a subscription that is in the tenant where you want to save the blueprint definition, then confirm that it is ok to save something in your Azure subscription. Or you can use ```-Force``` to skip the confirmation. 

Now you should see a new blueprint definition in Azure. You can update the blueprint by simply re-running the above command.

Thatâ€™s it!

You might run into some issues. Here are some common ones:
* **Missing a required property** â€“ this will result in a 400 bad request. This could be a lot of things. Make sure your blueprint and artifacts have all required properties.
* **```parameters``` in an artifact are not found in the main blueprint file.** Make sure all parameter references are complete. If you are using a parameter in an artifact, make sure it is defined in the main `blueprint.json`
* **```policyDefinitionId``` or ```roleDefinitionId``` does not exist.** If you are referencing a custom policy make sure that custom policy exists at or above the management group where the blueprint is saved. Custom role definitions are currently not supported for management groups.
	
### Next steps
From here you will need to [publish the blueprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal#publish-a-blueprint) and then [assign the blueprint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal#assign-a-blueprint) which you can do with either the azure portal or the rest API.
